When were Async and Await introduced in JS?

JavaScript Es8 onwards, that means in 2017,
those two keywords are Async and Await in Es8.

The async and the await are 2 keywords added to JS in 2017, Es8.

When JS gives a new topic in order to simplify an older complex
topic, that is called SYNTACTICAL SUGAR.

Async Await are synctatical sugar over promises.

In simple words we can say that they make async code look
more like sync code.

The async keyword is used to write functions that handle asynchronous actions.

We wrap our asynchronous logic inside a function prependedwith the async keyword.

writing async syntax:

//like arrow functions () => arrow tells its an arrow func, async tells its an async func.
async function myFunc(){
    //body here
};

myFunc();

It is simply for improved readability not performance.

1. if you put async in a function in js, then

it will get typecast into a Promise.
If you return nothing then it will reurn 'undefined' into
that Promise.

Await is an operator.
It is used before the func call which is expected to return a promise.

It returns the resolved value of a promise.

Can Async be used without Await?

async can be use without await.
but await cannot be used without async.

await keyword can only be used inside an async function.

Moreover sunce promises resolve in an indeterminate amount of time,
the await operator halts or pauses the execution of our async
function until a given promise is resolved.

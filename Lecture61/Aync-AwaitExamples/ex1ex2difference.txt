The difference between example 1 and example 2 is that

if in ex1 the code was having to wait to run like
SetTimeout on the code, then the line resSpan.innerHTML = ans;

already would have ran not waiting for the async function getNum().
it would run synchronously.

.then() in example2 would wait because .then()'s work is to run
asynchronously, so it would wait.

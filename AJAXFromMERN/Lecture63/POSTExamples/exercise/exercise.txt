Write a fetch API based application to send USER Details
to the REQ-RES API. It should include first_name, last_name,
and job_title.

Finally print the response returned by the server which contains
ID and TIMESTAMP

The url to be requested is htttps://reqres.in/api/users

keep in mind it is a dummy server, you can send it anything,

it returns us the ID and also the time at which it was sent to it.

see the demo of it then lets make an application from it.

got to reqres.in scroll down and click the POST option,
you can see what is the endpoint there,
and what is the response it gives back
status 201 if everything is good, 
and along with it our object we sent,
an id of that object,
and also the time at which it was created.

//THE EXERCISE DOESNT WORK BECAUSE THESE DAYS YOU NEED AN API KEY AS WELL THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
NOWADAYS...

IMPROVE YOUR CSS SKILLS NOW AND REVISE JS DOM, FETCH, PROMISES, JSON OBJECTS, METHODS, thats it
THEN YOU CAN GO FOR MERN AND YOU WILL STRAIGHT UP KILL IT.

//MAKE ALL THE PROJECTS WE HAVE ALREADY MADE WITH FETCH AND START MAKING YOUR OWN

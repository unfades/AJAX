Asynchronous is when code waits to run, when its time it runs.

In Javascript whenever JS sees API Communication ie XHR, fetch, Promise,
SetTimeout(),SetInterval(), JS takes it away from normal execution flow,
when its time to run those, it runs those sure. But it also goes in the flow
of synchronous programming.

Meaning what is not waiting to run will run, what is waiting to run runs immediately
when it is its time to run. That is asynchronous programming in JS.

synchronous is when one line runs, then other lines run after it,
asynchronous is when multiple pieces of code is running parallely.
JS is single threaded but it is possible in JS.
In Java this is only possible through multithreading.

Interview purpose - It is NOT multithreaded. It is a single threaded language,
that runs code line by line.

Asynchronous is when code waits to run, when its time it runs.

In Javascript whenever JS sees API Communication ie XHR, fetch, Promise,
SetTimeout(),SetInterval(), JS takes it away from normal execution flow,
when its time to run those, it runs those sure. But it also goes in the flow
of synchronous programming.

Meaning what is not waiting to run will run, what is waiting to run runs immediately
when it is its time to run. That is asynchronous programming in JS.

synchronous is when one line runs, then other lines run after it,
asynchronous is when multiple pieces of code is running parallely.
JS is single threaded but it is possible in JS.
In Java this is only possible through multithreading.

Interview purpose - It is NOT multithreaded. It is a single threaded language,
that runs code line by line.

If there are While Loops, why was there a For Loop invented after it.

Promises make our code modernized, its Es6 on.
Callbacks are before Es6, so if you use Promises,
your code is less, it's easier to implement,
and it looks like yes you have used Es6 JavaScript.

Even after this, there's Async Await, that makes our code even more easy.

These days use the fetch API...

All the lengthy code from XHR is made short from fetch().

As a programmer you have to write less amount of code, and you can achieve more.

Promises are not for normal coding, callbacks and promise are usually used for
Asynchronous programming.
It is ridiculous to make a program that adds two numbers using Promise.
But if you are using an API that gets 2 numbers and then you use AJAX,
meaning async coding, means promises are valid to use.

Theres 2 topics That programmers have trouble with in JS,
1. this in JS.
2. promise.

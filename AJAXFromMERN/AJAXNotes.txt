Basic JS - functions - objects
DOM - Accessing HTML - applying CSS
Event Handling - Click - KeyEvents - MouseEvents

In CSS, RuleSets of CSS,
applying classes in CSS, etc.

Full form of AJAX is what

Asynchronous JavaScript And XML

Synchronous Vs Asynchronous programming?

Synchronous means 1st instruction runs, then 2nd instruction runs,then 3rd etc..

ex: 

console.log("Adam");
console.log("Raden");
console.log("Sam");

Asynchronous means


in JS we know setTimeout()...

ex: 

console.log("Adam");
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Raden", 5000);
});
console.log("Sam");

we don't really want the printing of Sam to happen later...
like wait for Raden 5 seconds and then console.log Raden
then Sam,


if we seperate the setTimeout() code from the normal execution.
And it happens in the background, and the normal printing takes place.
The foreground activities work as intended, that is asynchronous programming.
That is asynchronous programming.

Stuff happening seperately is called asynchronous programming,
like reading comments that come from the server on youtube,
while the yt video is playing.

if youtube was synchronous it would be out of business.

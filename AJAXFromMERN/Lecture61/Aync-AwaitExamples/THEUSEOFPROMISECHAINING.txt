The use of promise chaining is imagine you doing this task.

In an application you are getting the user from an api,
thenyou are getting the services of the selected user
from another api,
then you are calculating the service cost for the users services
using yet another api,

this is happening of course in synchronous mode
through promise chaining via .then().then()
because you need one thing before you can use the other
thing that is why.

If you want to do Async Operations in sequence,
then that is made synchronous.

This is all being understood for fetch api.

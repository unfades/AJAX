the second statement in then() method is failure,
it is error right,
so you can use then, catch

it makes your code even easier.

Promise object:
document.getElementById("p").innerHTML = "Hello";

let doProject = makeProject();
doProject.catch((failure)=>{ console.log(failure);}); //<- now that is reduced code.

You can use method chaining here too with then and catch.

using then() and then catch() by . is chaining you already know because you chain a lot in Java.

Creating a Promise

let completed;
function makeProject(){
    return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
        //perform the task and set completed accordingly.
        if(completed){
            resolve("I have completed learning JS.");
        }else{
            reject("I haven't completed learning JS yet.");
        }
    });
}


Consuming a Promise:
//chaining makes code easier and much shorter
let doProject = makeProject();
doProject.then((result)) => { console.log(result); }).catch((error) => { console.log(error);});

//there is no benefit in the performance there is benefit in writing less syntax.
